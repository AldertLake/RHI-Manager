# RHI Switcher

**RHI Switcher for Blueprint** is an Unreal Engine plugin that allows you to change the Render Hardware Interface (RHI) ‚Äî such as **DirectX 11**, **DirectX 12**, or **Vulkan** ‚Äî directly from **Blueprints**.

This plugin changes the RHI by updating the DefaultGraphicsRHI key in the WindowsTargetPlatform.WindowsTargetSettings section of DefaultEngine.ini using GConfig->SetString when SetDesiredRHI is called with an enum value (e.g., Vulkan).
